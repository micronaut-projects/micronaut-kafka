/**
 * <p>An enum representing different strategies for committing offsets to Kafka when using {@link KafkaListener}.</p>
 *
 * <p>To track records that have been consumed Kafka allows committing offsets at a frequency desired by the developer. This tracking is done by committing offsets for a given partition back to Kafka.</p>
 *
 * <p>Depending on requirements you may wish the commit more or less frequently and you may not care whether the commit was successful or not. This enum allows configuring a range of policies for a Kafka consumer from leaving it down to the Kafka client (with {code AUTO}) to synchronously committing offsets after each consumer record is consumed.</p>
