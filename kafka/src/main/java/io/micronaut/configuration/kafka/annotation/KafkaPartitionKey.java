/**
 * Parameter level annotation for Kafka producers to indicate which parameter to compute the Kafka Partition from.
 *
 * <p>The partition is computed by first serializing the object, using an appropriate serializer from
 * {@link io.micronaut.configuration.kafka.serde.SerdeRegistry} as determined by, and then computing the partition
 * number using the same algorithm as Kafka's own {@code DefaultStrategy} ({@code murmur2})<p/>
 *
 * <p>If the provided value is {@code null} then the configured/default partitioning strategy takes place.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that while using {@link KafkaPartitionKey} in the same method as {@link KafkaPartition}
 * will not throw an exception, the outcome of doing so is left unspecified.</p>
