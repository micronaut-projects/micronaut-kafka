 * Parameter level annotation to indicate which parameter is bound to the Kafka Partition.

 * <p>When used in producers, indicates which partition is to be used. If the provided value is {@code null}
 * then the configured/default partitioning strategy takes place.</p>

 * <p>When used in consumers, it is populated with the partition that the record was received from.</p>
