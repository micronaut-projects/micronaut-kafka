If you want to disable micronaut-kafka entirely, you can set `kafka.enabled` to `false` in `application.yml`.

This will prevent the instantiation of all kafka-related beans.

You must, however, provide your own replacement implementations of any `@KafkaClient` interfaces:

.Creating Replacement KafkaClient Implementations
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/producer/fallback/MessageClientFallback.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testskafka}/producer/fallback/MessageClientFallback.java[tags=clazz, indent=0]
----

<1> Only instantiate when `kafka.enabled` is set to `false`
<2> Replace the `@KafkaClient` interface
<3> Implement the interface
<4> Provide an alternative implementation for all client methods
