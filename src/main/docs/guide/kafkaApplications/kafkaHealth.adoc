In addition to `http-server-netty`, if the `management` dependency is added, then Micronaut's <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> can be used to expose the health status of the Kafka consumer application.

For example if Kafka is not available the `/health` endpoint will return:

[source,json]
----
{
    "status": "DOWN",
    "details": {
        ...
        "kafka": {
            "status": "DOWN",
            "details": {
                "error": "java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment."
            }
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: By default, the details visible above are only shown to authenticated users. See the <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> documentation for how to configure that setting.

If you wish to disable the kafka health check while still using the `management` dependency you can set the property `kafka.health.enabled` to `false` in your application configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    health:
        enabled: false
----
