The interface KafkaSeekOperation.api:configuration.kafka.seek.KafkaSeekOperation.Builder[] provides several methods to create `seek` operations:

* `seek`: Creates an absolute seek operation.
* `seekRelativeToBeginning`: Creates a seek operation relative to the beginning.
* `seekToBeginning`: Creates a seek to the beginning operation.
* `seekRelativeToEnd`: Creates a seek operation relative to the end.
* `seekToEnd`: Creates a seek to the end operation.
* `seekForward`: Creates a forward seek operation.
* `seekBackward`: Creates a backward seek operation.
* `seekToTimestamp`: Creates a seek to the timestamp operation.

TIP: Your `@KafkaListener` bean can inherit all these methods from this interface, so you can create `seek` operations directly from your consumer method.
