The ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] annotation examples up until now have been relatively trivial, but Micronaut offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to the types of method signatures you can define.

The following sections detail examples of supported use cases.

== Specifying Topics

The ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.Topic[] annotation can be used at the method or the class level to specify which topics to be listened for.

Care needs to be taken when using ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.Topic[] at the class level because every public method of the class annotated with ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] will become a Kafka consumer, which may be undesirable.

You can specify multiple topics to listen for:

.Specifying Multiple Topics
[source,java]
----
@Topic({"fun-products", "awesome-products"})
----

You can also specify one or many regular expressions to listen for:

.Using regular expressions to match Topics
[source,java]
----
@Topic(patterns="products-\\w+")
----


== Available Annotations

There are a number of annotations available that allow you to specify how a method argument is bound.

The following table summarizes the annotations and their purpose, with an example:

.Kafka Messaging Annotations
|===
|Annotation |Description |Example

|https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/messaging/annotation/Body.html[@Body]
| Allows explicitly indicating the body of the message
|`@Body Product product`

|https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/messaging/annotation/Header.html[@Header]
| Allows binding a parameter to a message header
|`@Header("X-My-Header") String myHeader`

|ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaKey[]
| Allows specifying the parameter that is the key
|`@KafkaKey String key`

|===

For example, you can use the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/messaging/annotation/Header.html[@Header] annotation to bind a parameter value from a header contained within a `ConsumerRecord`.


== Topics, Partitions and Offsets

If you want a reference to the topic, partition or offset it is a simple matter of defining a parameter for each.

The following table summarizes example parameters and how they related to the `ConsumerRecord` being processed:

.@KafkaListener Method Parameters
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`String topic`
| The name of the topic

|`long offset`
| The offset of the `ConsumerRecord`

|`int partition`
| The partition of the `ConsumerRecord`

|`long timestamp`
| The timestamp of the `ConsumerRecord`

|===

As an example, following listener method will receive all of the above mentioned parameters:

.Specifying Parameters for offset, topic etc.
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/consumer/config/ProductListener.java[tags=method, indent=0]
----

<1> The Kafka key
<2> The message body
<3> The offset of the `ConsumerRecord`
<4> The partition of the `ConsumerRecord`
<5> The topic. Note that the `@Topic` annotation supports multiple topics.
<6> The timestamp of the `ConsumerRecord`

== Receiving a ConsumerRecord

If you prefer you can also receive the entire `ConsumerRecord` object being listened for. In this case you should specify appropriate generic types for the key and value of the `ConsumerRecord` so that Micronaut can pick the correct deserializer for each.

Consider the following example:

.Specifying Parameters for offset, topic etc.
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/consumer/config/ProductListener.java[tags=consumeRecord, indent=0]
----

<1> The method signature accepts a `ConsumerRecord` that specifies a `String` for the key type and a POJO (`Product`) for the value type.
<2> The `value()` method is used to retrieve the value
<3> The `key()` method is used to retrieve the key

== Receiving and returning Reactive Types

In addition to common Java types and POJOs you can also define listener methods that receive a Reactive type such as a rx:Single[] or a Reactor `Mono`. For example:

.Using Reactive Types
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/consumer/reactive/ProductListener.java[tags=method, indent=0]
----

<1> The `@KafkaKey` annotation is used to indicate the key
<2> A rx:Single[] is used to receive the message body
<3> The `doOnSuccess` method is used to process the result

Note that in this case the method returns an `rx:Single[]` this indicates to Micronaut that the `poll` loop should continue and if `enable.auto.commit` is set to `true` (the default) the offsets will be committed potentially before the `doOnSuccess` is called.

The idea here is that you are able to write consumers that don't block, however care must be taken in the case where an error occurs in the `doOnSuccess` method otherwise the message could be lost. You could for example re-deliver the message in case of an error.

Alternatively, you can use the ann:core.annotation.Blocking[] annotation to tell Micronaut to subscribe to the returned reactive type in a blocking manner which will result in blocking the `poll` loop, preventing offsets from being committed automatically:

.Blocking with Reactive Consumers
[source,java]
----
@Blocking
@Topic("reactive-products")
public Single<Product> receive(
    ...
}
----
