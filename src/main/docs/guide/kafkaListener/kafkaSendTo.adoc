On any `@KafkaListener` method that returns a value, you can use the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/messaging/annotation/SendTo.html[@SendTo] annotation to forward the return value to the topic or topics specified by the `@SendTo` annotation.

The key of the original `ConsumerRecord` will be used as the key when forwarding the message.

.Forwarding with @SendTo

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.sendto.ProductListener[tags=method, indent=0]


<1> The topic subscribed to is `awesome-products`
<2> The topic to send the result to is `product-quantities`
<3> The return value is used to indicate the value to forward

You can also do the same using Reactive programming:

.Forwarding Reactively with @SendTo

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.sendto.ProductListener[tags=reactive, indent=0]

<1> The topic subscribed to is `awesome-products`
<2> The topic to send the result to is `product-quantities`
<3> The return is mapped from the single to the value of the quantity

In the reactive case the `poll` loop will continue and will not wait for the record to be sent unless you specifically annotate the method with ann:core.annotation.Blocking[].

To enable transactional sending of the messages you need to define `producerTransactionalId` in `@KafkaListener`.

.Transactional consumer-producer

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.sendto.WordCounter[tags=transactional, indent=0]


<1> The id of the producer to load additional config properties
<2> The transactional id that is required to enable transactional processing
<3> Enable offset strategy to commit the offsets to the transaction
<4> Consumer read messages isolation
