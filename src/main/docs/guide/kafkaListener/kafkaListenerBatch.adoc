By default ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] listener methods will receive each link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerRecord.html[ConsumerRecord] one by one.

There may be cases where you prefer to receive all of the link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerRecord.html[ConsumerRecord] data from the link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerRecords.html[ConsumerRecords] holder object in one go.

To achieve this you can set the `batch` member of the ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] to `true` and specify a container type (typically `List`) to receive all of the data:

.Receiving a Batch of Records

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookListener[tags="imports,clazz,method", indent=0]

<1> The ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] annotation's `batch` member is set to `true`
<2> The method defines that it receives a list of `Book` instances
<3> The method processes the entire batch

Note in the previous case offsets will automatically be committed for the whole batch by default when the method returns without error.

== Manually Committing Offsets with Batch

You can also take more control of committing offsets when doing batch processing by specifying a method that receives the offsets in addition to the batch:

.Committing Offsets Manually with Batch

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookListener[tags=manual, indent=0]

<1> The method receives the batch of books as a list of consumer records
<2> Each record is processed
<3> The offset, partition and topic is read for the record
<4> Offsets are committed

This example is fairly trivial in that it commits offsets after processing each record in a batch, but you can for example commit after processing every 10, or every 100 or whatever makes sense for your application.

== Reactive Batch Processing

Batch listeners also support defining reactive types (Reactor `Flux` or RxJava rx:Flowable[]) as the method argument.

Add the library https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-reactor/latest/guide/[Micronaut Reactor] or https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rxjava3/latest/guide/[Micronaut RxJava 3] to your application's dependencies.

In this case the method will be passed a reactive type that can be returned from the method allowing non-blocking processing of the batch:

.Reactive Processing of Batch Records

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookListener[tags=reactive, indent=0]

Remember that as with non batch processing, the reactive type will be subscribed to on a different thread and offsets will be committed automatically likely prior to the point when the reactive type is subscribed to.

This means that you should only use reactive processing if message durability is not a requirement and you may wish to implement message re-delivery upon failure.
