=== Automatically Committing Offsets

The way offsets are handled by a ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] bean is defined by the api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy[] enum.

The following table summarizes the enum values and behaviour:

.Kafka Messaging Annotations
|===
|Value |Description

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#AUTO[]
|Automatically commit offsets. Sets `enable.auto.commit` to `true`

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#DISABLED[]
|Disables automatically committing offsets. Sets `enable.auto.commit` to `false`

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#SYNC[]
|Commits offsets manually at the end of each `poll()` loop if no exceptions occur. Sets `enable.auto.commit` to `false`

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#ASYNC[]
|Asynchronously commits offsets manually at the end of each `poll()` loop if no exceptions occur. Sets `enable.auto.commit` to `false`

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#SYNC_PER_RECORD[]
|Commits offsets manually after each `ConsumerRecord` is processed. Sets `enable.auto.commit` to `false`

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#ASYNC_PER_RECORD[]
|Commits offsets asynchronously after each `ConsumerRecord` is processed. Sets `enable.auto.commit` to `false`

|api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#SEND_TO_TRANSACTION[]
|Only available when the transactional producer is enabled for `@SendTo`. Sends offsets to transaction using method `sendOffsetsToTransaction` of `org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Producer`.

|===

Depending on the your level of paranoia or durability requirements you can choose to tune how and when offsets are committed.

=== Manually Committing Offsets

If you set the `OffsetStrategy` to api:configuration.kafka.annotation.OffsetStrategy#DISABLED[] it becomes your responsibility to commit offsets.

There are a couple of ways that can be achieved.

The simplest way is to define an argument of type api:configuration.kafka.Acknowledgement[] and call the `ack()` method to commit offsets synchronously:

.Committing offsets with `ack()`

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.offsets.ack.ProductListener[tags="clazz"]

<1> Committing offsets automatically is disabled
<2> The listener method specifies a parameter of type api:configuration.kafka.Acknowledgement[]
<3> The `ack()` method is called once the record has been processed

Alternatively, you an supply a `KafkaConsumer` method argument and then call `commitSync` (or `commitAsync`) yourself when you are ready to commit offsets:

.Committing offsets with the `KafkaConsumer` API

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.offsets.manual.ProductListener[tags="imports,clazz"]

<1> Committing offsets automatically is disabled
<2> The listener method specifies that it receives the offset data and a `KafkaConsumer`
<3> The `commitSync()` method is called once the record has been processed
