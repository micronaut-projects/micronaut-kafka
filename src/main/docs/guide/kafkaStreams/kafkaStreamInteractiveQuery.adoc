When using streams you can set a state store for your stream using a store builder and telling the stream to store its data.  In the above example for the Kafka Streams Word Count, the output is materialized to a named store that can later be retrieved via the Interactive Query Service.  Apache Kafka docs https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html#querying-local-key-value-stores[available here].

You can inject the `InteractiveQueryService` and use the method `getQueryableStore` to get values from a state store.

An example service that wraps the `InteractiveQueryService` is included below.  This is here to illustrate that when calling the `getQueryableStore` method you must provide the store name and preferably the type of key and value you are trying to retrieve.
