In addition to `http-server-netty`, if the `management` dependency is added, then Micronaut's <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> can be used to expose the health status of the Kafka streams application.

For example stream health at the `/health` endpoint will return:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "kafkaStreams": {
      "name": "my-application",
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "named-stream": {
          "name": "my-application",
          "status": "UP",
          "details": {
            "adminClientId": "my-consumer-id-admin",
            "restoreConsumerClientId": "my-consumer-id-StreamThread-1-restore-consumer",
            "threadState": "RUNNING",
            "producerClientIds": [
              "my-consumer-id-StreamThread-1-producer"
            ],
            "consumerClientId": "my-consumer-id-StreamThread-1-consumer",
            "threadName": "my-consumer-id-StreamThread-1"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
----

NOTE: By default, the details visible above are only shown to authenticated users. See the <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> documentation for how to configure that setting.

If you wish to disable the Kafka streams health check while still using the `management` dependency you can set the property `kafka.streams.health.enabled` to `false` in your application configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    streams:
	    health:
		    enabled: false
