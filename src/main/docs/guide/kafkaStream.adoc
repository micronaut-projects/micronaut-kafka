[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `kafka-streams` feature to include a simple Kafka Streams configuration in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features kafka-streams
----
====

https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/[Kafka Streams] is a platform for building real time streaming applications.

When using Micronaut with Kafka Stream, your application gains all of the features from Micronaut (configuration management, AOP, DI, health checks etc.), simplifying the construction of Kafka Stream applications.

Since Micronaut's DI and AOP is compile time, you can build low overhead stream applications with ease.

=== Defining Kafka Streams

To define Kafka Streams you should first add the `kafka-streams` configuration to your build.

dependency:micronaut-kafka-streams[groupId="io.micronaut.configuration"]

The minimum configuration required is to set the Kafka bootstrap servers:

.Configuring Kafka
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    bootstrap:
        servers: localhost:9092
----


You should then define a ann:context.annotation.Factory[] for your streams that defines beans that return a `KStream`. For example to implement the Word Count example from the Kafka Streams documentation:


.Kafka Streams Word Count
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafkastreams}/WordCountStream.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testskafkastreams}/WordCountStream.java[tags=clazz, indent=0]

include::{testskafkastreams}/WordCountStream.java[tags=wordCountStream, indent=4]

}
----

<1> The input topic
<2> The output topic
<3> An instance of api:configuration.kafka.streams.ConfiguredStreamBuilder[] is injected that allows mutating the configuration
<4> Materialize the count stream and save to a state store

NOTE: With Kafka streams the key and value `Serdes` (serializer/deserializer) must be classes with a zero argument constructor. If you wish to use JSON (de)serialization you can subclass api:configuration.kafka.serde.JsonSerde[] to define your `Serdes`

You can use the ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaClient[] annotation to send a sentence to be processed by the above stream:

.Defining a Kafka Client
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafkastreams}/WordCountClient.java[]
----

You can also define a ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener[] to listen for the result of the word count stream:

.Defining a Kafka Listener
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafkastreams}/WordCountListener.java[]
----


=== Configuring Kafka Streams

You can define multiple Kafka streams each with their own unique configuration. To do this you should define the configuration with `kafka.streams.[STREAM-NAME]`. For example in `application.yml`:

.Defining Per Stream Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    streams:
        my-stream:
            num:
                stream:
                    threads: 10
----

The above configuration sets the `num.stream.threads` setting of the Kafka `StreamsConfig` to `10` for a stream named `my-stream`.

You can then inject a api:configuration.kafka.streams.ConfiguredStreamBuilder[] specfically for the above configuration using `javax.inject.Named`:

.Kafka Streams Word Count
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafkastreams}/WordCountStream.java[tags=namedStream, indent=0]
}
----

=== Interactive Query Service

When using streams you can set a state store for your stream using a store builder and telling the stream to store its data.  In the above example for the Kafka Streams Word Count, the output is materialized to a named store that can later be retrieved via the Interactive Query Service.  Apache Kafka docs https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html#querying-local-key-value-stores[available here].

You can inject the `InteractiveQueryService` and use the method `getQueryableStore` to get values from a state store.

[source,java]
----
include::{kafkastreams}/InteractiveQueryService.java[tags=getQueryableStore, indent=0]
----

An example service that wraps the `InteractiveQueryService` is included below.  This is here to illustrate that when calling the `getQueryableStore` method you must provide the store name and preferably the type of key and value you are trying to retrieve.

[source,java]
----
include::{testkafkastreams}/InteractiveQueryServiceExample.java[]
