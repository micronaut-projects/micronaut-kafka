By default if you define a method that takes a container type such as a jdk:java.util.List[] the list will be serialized using the specified `value.serializer` (the default will result in a JSON array).

For example the following two methods will both send serialized arrays:

.Sending Arrays and Lists
[source,java]
----
@Topic("books")
void sendList(List<Book> books);

@Topic("books")
void sendBooks(Book...books);
----

Instead of a sending a serialized array you may wish to instead send batches of link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html[ProducerRecord] either synchronously or asynchronously.

To do this you can specify a value of `true` to the `batch` member of the ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaClient[] annotation:

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches
[source,java]
----
@KafkaClient(batch=true)
@Topic("books")
void send(List<Book> books);
----

In the above case instead of sending a serialized array the client implementation will iterate over each item in the list and send a `ProducerRecord` for each. The previous example is blocking, however you can return a reactive type if desired:

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches Reactively
[source,java]
----
@KafkaClient(batch=true)
@Topic("books")
Flowable<RecordMetadata> send(List<Book> books);
----

You can also use an unbound reactive type such as rx:Flowable[] as the source of your batch data:

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches from a Flowable
[source,java]
----
@KafkaClient(batch=true)
@Topic("books")
Flowable<RecordMetadata> send(Flowable<Book> books);
----

For sending the data with Kafka key you need to use `@KafkaKey` annotation with the list of keys (even if the list consists of single member):

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches with Kafka key
[source,java]
----
@KafkaClient(batch=true)
@Topic("books")
void send(@KafkaKey List<String> keys, List<Book> books);
----
