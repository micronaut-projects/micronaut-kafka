By default if you define a method that takes a container type such as a jdk:java.util.List[] the list will be serialized using the specified `value.serializer` (the default will result in a JSON array).

For example the following two methods will both send serialized arrays:

.Sending Arrays and Lists

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookClient[tags="lists,arrays", indent = 0]

Instead of a sending a serialized array you may wish to instead send batches of link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html[ProducerRecord] either synchronously or asynchronously.

To do this you can specify a value of `true` to the `batch` member of the ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaClient[] annotation:

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookClient[tags="clazz,lists"]

In the above case instead of sending a serialized array the client implementation will iterate over each item in the list and send a `ProducerRecord` for each. The previous example is blocking, however you can return a reactive type if desired:

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches Reactively

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookClient[tags="clazz,reactive"]

You can also use an unbound reactive type such as `Flux` as the source of your batch data:

.Sending `ProducerRecord` batches from a Flux

snippet::io.micronaut.kafka.docs.consumer.batch.BookClient[tags="clazz,flux"]
