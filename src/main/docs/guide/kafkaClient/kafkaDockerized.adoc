The previous section introduced the ability to use a Kafka docker container. This is possible by using 
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/[Micronaut Test Resources].

The recommended approach to get started is to use https://micronaut.io/launch[Micronaut Launch] and select the `test-resources` feature.

Micronaut Test Resources will automatically start a Kafka container and provide the value of the `kafka.bootstrap.servers` property.

TIP: For more information, see the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/snapshot/guide/#modules-kafka[Kafka section of the Test Resources documentation].
