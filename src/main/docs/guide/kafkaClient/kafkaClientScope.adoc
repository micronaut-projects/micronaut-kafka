If you need maximum flexibility and don't want to use the ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaClient[] support you can use the `@KafkaClient` annotation as qualifier for dependency injection of link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html[KafkaProducer] instances.

Consider the following example:

.Using a KafkaProducer directly
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/producer/inject/BookSender.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testskafka}/producer/inject/BookSender.java[tags=clazz, indent=0]
----

<1> The `Producer` is dependency injected into the constructor. If not specified in configuration, the key and value serializer are inferred from the generic type arguments.
<2> The `Producer` is used to send records

Note that there is no need to call the `close()` method to shut down the `KafkaProducer`, it is fully managed by Micronaut and will be shutdown when the application shuts down.

The previous example can be tested in JUnit with the following test:


.Using a KafkaProducer directly
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/producer/inject/BookSenderTest.java[tags=test, indent=0]
----

<1> An embedded version of Kafka is used
<2> The `BookSender` is retrieved from the api:context.ApplicationContext[] and a `ProducerRecord` sent

By using the link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html[KafkaProducer] API directly you open up even more options if you require transactions (exactly-once delivery) or want control over when records are flushed etc.
