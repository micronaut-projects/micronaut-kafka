=== @KafkaClient and Producer Properties

There are a number of ways to pass configuration properties to the link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html[KafkaProducer]. You can set default producer properties using `kafka.producers.default` in `application.yml`:

.Applying Default Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    producers:
        default:
            retries: 5
----

Any property in the link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerConfig.html[ProducerConfig] class can be set. The above example will set the default number of times to retry sending a record.

=== Per @KafkaClient Producer Properties

To configure different properties for each client, you should set a `@KafkaClient` id using the annotation:

.Using a Client ID
[source,java]
----
@KafkaClient("product-client")
----

This serves 2 purposes. Firstly it sets the value of the `client.id` setting used to build the `KafkaProducer`. Secondly, it allows you to apply per producer configuration in `application.yml`:

.Applying Default Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    producers:
        product-client:
            retries: 5
----

Finally, the ann:configuration.kafka.annotation.KafkaClient[] annotation itself provides a `properties` member that you can use to set producer specific properties:

.Configuring Producer Properties with @KafkaClient
[source,java]
----
include::{testskafka}/producer/config/ProductClient.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testskafka}/producer/config/ProductClient.java[tags=clazz, indent=0]
    ...
}
----

=== @KafkaClient and Serializers

When serializing keys and values Micronaut will by default attempt to automatically pick a link:{kafkaapi}/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/Serializer.html[Serializer] to use. This is done via the api:configuration.kafka.serde.CompositeSerdeRegistry[] bean.

TIP: You can replace the default api:configuration.kafka.serde.SerdeRegistry[] bean with your own implementation by defining a bean that uses `@Replaces(CompositeSerdeRegistry.class)`. See the section on <<replaces, Bean Replacement>>.

All common `java.lang` types (`String`, `Integer`, primitives etc.) are supported and for POJOs by default a Jackson based JSON serializer is used.

You can, however, explicitly override the `Serializer` used by providing the appropriate configuration in `application.yml`:

.Applying Default Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
kafka:
    producers:
        product-client:
            value:
                serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArraySerializer
----

You may want to do this if for example you choose an alternative serialization format such as Avro or Protobuf.
